      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-this-book&#34;&gt;About this book&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea of humans falling in love with artificial beings is not a modern conception. Our relationship with artificial partners has come a long way since Pygmalion and his ivory lover.

This interest is evidenced by the increase in media coverage, TV documentaries and films on this topic, as well as the active research efforts within the academic community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
