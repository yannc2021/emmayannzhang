In these clips from my exclusive interview on WTOP Radio, I share how Kissenger lets people send virtual kisses, bringing physical intimacy into everyday digital communication. I also reveal our next big idea for Kissenger: turning it into a robotic head you can actually kiss. One day you might kiss a robot â€” if you want to.
