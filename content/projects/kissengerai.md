KissengerAI is my second startup journey. It is an AI companion that lets users chat, bond, and share kisses with real touch sensations. This project is the beginning of a bigger vision: to bring our sense of touch into AI systems that can sense, understand and respond to touch. Future integrations with AI-driven hardware will redefine the way we interact with emotional AI and robots.
