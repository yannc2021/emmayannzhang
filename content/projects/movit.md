Movit is a wearable gesture control wristband that allows users to control mobile and PC apps remotely using intuitive hand gestures. The wristband, embedded with an accelerometer, is lightweight, affordable, and easily integrates with various devices. Movit recognizes user-defined gestures for a more personalized experience. It features a novel signal gesture method to distinguish control gestures from natural hand movements, enabling completely hands-free operation. Movit connects to mobile phones and computers via Bluetooth Low Energy.
