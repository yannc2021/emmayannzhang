Youtube is a popular video streaming service ( from a company that is known for tracking and profiling, though). The solution is to host the poster yourself and link it to Youtube. This can be done using this shortcode.

You can see it in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show a Youtube video embed, write the following 'code':


```
{{</* youtube "qtIqKaDlqXo" "/uploads/youtubeposter.jpg" */>}} 
```

<!--{{< youtube "qtIqKaDlqXo" "/uploads/youtubeposter.jpg" >}} -->
