The gallery shortcode enables you to transform a folder in your asset directory into an image gallery. You can see it in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show an image gallery, write the following 'code':

```
{{</* gallery dir="/uploads/gallery/" */>}} 
```

<!--{{< gallery dir="/uploads/gallery/" >}} -->
