If you want to link to social media you can use the social media buttons shortcode. The settings for these icons can be found in the 'footer.yaml' file in the data directory. You can see the social buttons in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show the social buttons, write the following shortcode:

```
{{</* socialbuttons */>}}
```

<!--{{< socialbuttons >}}-->
