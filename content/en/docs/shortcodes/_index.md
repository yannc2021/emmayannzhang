You might wonder what the difference is between a Hugo 'shortcode' and a Hugo 'brick'. Shortcodes are placing reusable content in a kind of 'inline' way (say in between two paragraphs). An example of a shortcode is a video. Bricks are complete sets of content. An example of a brick is a 'Call to action brick'. Below you find a list of available shortcodes.
