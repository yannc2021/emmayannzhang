Contact buttons offer a quick and visual way to contact the site owner. The settings for these buttons can be found in the 'contact' section of the 'general.yaml' file in the data directory. You can see the contact buttons in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show the contact buttons, write the following shortcode:


```
{{</* contactbuttons */>}}
```

<!--{{< contactbuttons >}}-->
