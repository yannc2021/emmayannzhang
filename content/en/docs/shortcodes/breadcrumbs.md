title: Breadcrumbs
---

Breadcrumb paths are a single line of links (often placed above the title) that show a page's location in the site hierarchy. Every website should have breadcrumbs, as it benefits SEO as well as the users understanding of the sites structure. See in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show the breadcrumbs, write the following 'code':

```
{{</* breadcrumbs */>}}
```

<!--{{< breadcrumbs >}}-->
