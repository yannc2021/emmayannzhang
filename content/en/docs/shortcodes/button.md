Buttons are a great way to drive conversion. They are actually links with the class 'button'. You can see them in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show a button, write the following 'code':


```
{{</* button "Get started for free" "/get-started/" */>}}
```

<!--{{< button "Get started for free" "/get-started/" >}}-->
