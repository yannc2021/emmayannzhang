title: Call to action
---

It is always nice (and good for conversion) to show a 'Call to action' on your page (a short text, leading to a button and a related image). An example of such a 'Call to action brick' can be found in the footer of this page. It is the block titled 'Get started with Hugobricks today!'.

## Use this brick

You probably want the CTA brick to be the same on every page. You can stack the brick on top of other bricks, which is explained in the [Bricks page](/docs/bricks/). If you want the brick to be the same on every page you can use this brick by writing:

```
{{</* brick_cta */>}}{{</* /brick_cta */>}}
```

## Content in content/en/bricks/cta.md

The content of the brick should be stored in the file 'cta.md' in the 'content/en/bricks/' folder. Note that the filename is equal to the name of the brick (without 'brick_'). This file should look like this:

```

title: cta

```

## Page-specific content 

If you want your content to be different on a specific page, you can override it by placing your custom content in between the opening and closing tag of the brick, like this:


```
{{</* brick_cta */>}}

... page specific content here...

{{</* /brick_cta */>}}
```

<!--{{< brick_cta >}}{{< /brick_cta >}}-->
