# The sky is the limit, with Hugobricks!

Hugobricks is a free website theme for Hugo. It makes building Hugo websites child's play due to its stackable (LEGO-like) content bricks. How about this 'intro brick' with a clear call-to-action? Stack it on top of some image bricks and a pricing table and build a complete website in seconds!
