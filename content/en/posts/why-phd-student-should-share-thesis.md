Because it shouldn't be hidden behind academic paywalls

Have you ever been told that nobody will read your PhD thesis except for your supervisor and your mother?

And let’s be honest, your mom might just skip to the acknowledgements to make sure her name is mentioned.

You’re spending four, five, maybe even six years of the prime time of your life diving deep into a topic you care about. You know your research matters. If you don’t, you probably shouldn’t have wasted so much time on it. So why keep it hidden behind academic paywalls and dense jargon?

Your ideas deserve an audience beyond the few people who pretend to understand them . Writing about your research for a wider audience can:

- Boost your visibility and credibility in your field
- Attract collaborators or job opportunities
- Help you clarify your own thinking
- Find practical applications outside of academia

Here’s how to get started:

## Start a Blog
Dedicate a space where you can break down your research into digestible, engaging stories. Write like you're explaining your work to a curious high school student or your favorite cousin.

## Tweet Your Journey
Twitter/X is a great platform for academic networking. Share short insights, challenges, and mini breakthroughs. Use threads to unpack complex ideas in simple steps.

## Repurpose Content
Turn sections of your thesis into blog posts, LinkedIn articles, or short videos. What’s routine to you may be mind-blowing to someone else.

## Connect It to Real Life
Frame your research in terms of real-world problems it addresses or big-picture questions it touches. People want to know why your work matters. Show them.

## Keep It Consistent
You don’t need to write a masterpiece every week. Even one post a month adds up. Build the habit, and over time you’ll build a presence.

Your thesis might end up on a library shelf or a digital archive, but your voice can reach much further—if you let it. Start now. Someone out there needs to hear what you're working on.
