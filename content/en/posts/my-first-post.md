This is the beginning of a new series where Iâ€™ll be sharing thoughts and updates on my research and interests. 

I'm a researcher and AI founder exploring the emotional side of technology and human-AI interactions. I'm particularly interested in how we can design and develop AI algorithms and hardware interfaces that allow AI to perceive, understand and respond to social touch. 

## My research asks questions like:

- How can we make AI more emotional?
- What makes a relationship between a human and an AI feel meaningful or trusting?
- What technologies can we design to integrate our sense of touch into AI agents and AI hardware or social robots?

I believe that touch is often overlooked in our focus on developing new AI technologies, yet it is one of the most powerful forms of non-verbal communication for fostering deep emotional connection and trust in human relationships. We have reached a point where AI is involved in every aspect of our life, and soon we will see AI being integrated in our personal relationships and emotions too. Having AI that can sense touch, understand its emotional and social meanings, and respond appropriately to touch interactions should be a key focus in advancing emotionally intelligent AI. This is a topic I like to call **Haptic-AI**: the integration of touch and emotional intelligence into AI.

This blog is where I'll share and promote ideas from my research in an accessible way, aiming to spark interest in Haptic-AI in both the research and developer communities. I hope to connect with others who are also passionate about the future of human-AI relationships.
