abstract: "Internet communication has revolutionised human communication, which is rapidly migrating from the physical world to the digital world. However, digital communication is often criticised for encouraging social isolation, and diminishing our abilities to empathise and form emotional bonds. Communication technologies still focus on transmitting visual and audio information, thus missing the emotional exchange during face-to-face interaction expressed through physical contact and non-verbal cues."
