abstract: "The sense of touch has a significant role in establishing effective communication with customers and improving brand awareness and product experience. With mobile and wearable devices at the core of communication today, mobile marketing is crucial for advertisers to appeal to a larger audience and new haptic technologies should be developed to deliver more realistic and meaningful haptic messages to these devices. We introduce RingU and Kissenger, two haptic devices for mobile devices that enhance the vibration haptic feedback using force-variable vibrotactile and linear force actuation, allowing users to hug and kiss each other over the Internet in real-time. Businesses can use these devices to communicate with their customers using haptic stimulations to enhance customer experience and advertise their services. Artist agencies or game producers could also increase the popularity of their idols and virtual characters by allowing fans from worldwide to come in \"close contact\" with them."
