abstract: "As human communication is rapidly migrating from the physical world to the digital world, it is crucial to develop affective communication systems to enable the expression of intimacy, emotion and empathy over the Internet, as these are essential elements in forming social relationships. A multisensory, real-time kissing device, Kissenger, is developed to transmit multisensory kissing sensations remotely using mobile phones. The aim is to provide an intimate communication channel for families and friends to physically interact with each other remotely, in order to effectively convey deep emotions and intimacy through a multisensory internet communication experience."
