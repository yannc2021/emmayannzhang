    subtitle="AI Researcher"
    description="I am an AI researcher with expertise in both hardware and software development. My research focuses on connecting human emotions with technology through multisensory communication and emotionally intelligent AI systems. I am to integrate our sense of touch into AI agents, social robots, and wearable devices, allowing them to sense, interpret and respond to human touch interaction. I created <emph>Kissenger</emph>, the worldâ€™s first device for transmitting kisses digitally. My work has been featured in international press such as BBC, Discovery Channel, Wired, IEEE Spectrum, and The Times. I've been invited to showcase my research at top exhibitions and conferences such as the Ars Electronica Festival, VivaTech Paris, Germany Museum of Technology, and CeBIT conference, among others."
