abstract: "A real-time bilateral kiss communication interface is developed for transmitting multisensory kissing sensations over the Internet using mobile phones. Kissenger consists of a plugin haptic device that attaches to a mobile phone via the audio jack and a mobile application that connects to the device and sends real-time data stream over the Internet. The device uses an array of linear actuators to generate haptic stimulations on the human lips and force sensors to measure the force output. Bilateral force-feedback control is used to synchronise the forces on both sides of the system. The aim is to provide an intimate communication channel for couples and families to physically interact with each other in order to maintain close relationships even at a distance. The stimulation of other sensory modalities such as taste and smell are discussed to provide a full multisensory communication experience."
