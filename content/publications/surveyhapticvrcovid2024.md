abstract: "This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the advancements and applications of haptic technologies, which are methods that facilitate the sense of touch and movement, in virtual reality (VR) during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to identify and classify the various domains in which haptic technologies have been utilized or can be adapted to combat the unique challenges posed by the pandemic or public health emergencies in general. Existing reviews and surveys that concentrate on the applications of haptic technologies during the Covid-19 pandemic are often limited to specific domains; this survey strives to identify and consolidate all application domains discussed in the literature, including healthcare, medical training, education, social communication, and fashion and retail. The paper reviews various haptic devices and systems and discusses the technological advancements that have been made to offer more realistic and immersive VR experiences. It also addresses challenges in haptic technology in VR, including fidelity, ethical, and privacy considerations, and cost and accessibility issues."
