abstract: "In recent years, generative transformers have become increasingly prevalent in the field of artificial intelligence, especially within the scope of natural language processing. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of these models, beginning with the foundational theories introduced by Alan Turing and extending to contemporary generative transformer architectures. The manuscript serves as a review, historical account, and tutorial, aiming to offer a thorough understanding of the modelsâ€™ importance, underlying principles, and wide-ranging applications. The tutorial section includes a practical guide for constructing a basic generative transformer model. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges, ethical implications, and future directions in the study of generative models."
