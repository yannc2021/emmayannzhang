abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, affecting all facets of human life. The rapid spread of the virus necessitated urgent responses from the healthcare sector, with artificial intelligence (AI) taking center stage as a pivotal tool in this fight. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the multifaceted role of AI during the pandemic, spanning from early detection and diagnosis to treatment, management, and the development of vaccines. We delve into the ethical and societal implications of deploying AI in such critical scenarios, discussing data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accessibility. The paper also presents various case studies, highlighting country-specific implementations and the dichotomy of success stories and failures. Furthermore, we explore the future directions of AI in healthcare, emphasizing emerging technologies and policy recommendations that could shape post-pandemic health-care systems. The conclusion synthesizes these insights, reflecting on the lessons learned and the prospective landscape of AI in global health. This paper aims to serve as a cornerstone for policymakers, health-care providers, and AI researchers, guiding the responsible and effective integration of AI in future health-care strategies."
